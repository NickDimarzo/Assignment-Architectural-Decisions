## Summary
This ADR aims to determine the most suitable UI framework for the mobile application developed for the retail company, considering factors such as user experience, development efficiency, platform compatibility, and future scalability

### Issue
The development team needs to decide on the UI framework to be used for the mobile application's user interface.

### Decision
After evaluating the requirements and constraints, the team has decided to use the React Native framework for developing the mobile app's UI.

### Status
Accepted

## Details

### Assumptions
1. The retail company's target audience primarily uses iOS and Android devices.
2. The team has familiarity and expertise in React Native development.
3. The UI requirements can be efficiently implemented using React Native components and third-party libraries.

### Constraints
1. Limited development time and budget.
2. The app must provide a responsive and intuitive user interface.

### Positions
1. Native UI: Provides a highly native and optimized experience but requires separate UI development efforts for each platform.
2. React Native: Offers a cross-platform solution with code reuse, good performance, and a large community support.

### Argument
Using the React Native framework for developing the mobile app's UI aligns with the retail company's requirements and constraints. It allows for code reuse across platforms, reducing development effort and cost. React Native offers a rich set of UI components and third-party libraries, providing the flexibility to create a responsive and intuitive user interface.

### Implications
1. Reduced development time and cost compared to developing separate UIs for iOS and Android.
2. The UI may not have the exact look and feel of a fully native app, although it can be customized to closely match the platform's UI guidelines.
3. The team will need to ensure compatibility with the chosen React Native version and maintain awareness of any platform-specific limitations or updates.
