## Summary
This ADR aims to determine the permissions model for the mobile application developed for the retail company, considering factors such as user privacy, security, and the app's functionality requirements.

### Issue
The development team needs to decide on the permissions model to be implemented in the mobile application to ensure the appropriate access to device resources and user data.

### Decision
After evaluating the requirements and constraints, the team has decided to implement a granular permissions model based on the principle of least privilege.

### Status
Accepted

## Details

### Assumptions
1. The retail company's app will be deployed on iOS and Android platforms.
2. The team has a clear understanding of the app's functionality and its associated permissions requirements.
3. The team has considered privacy and security guidelines and regulations when determining the permissions model.

### Constraints
1. Limited development time and budget.
2. The app should respect user privacy by requesting only the necessary permissions.

### Positions
1. Granular Permissions Model: Provides better control over app permissions, enhances user privacy and security, and ensures the app only has access to necessary resources.
2. Default Permissions: Requests permissions aligned with the app's core functionality while avoiding unnecessary permissions.

### Argument
Implementing a granular permissions model based on the principle of least privilege aligns with the retail company's requirements and constraints. It enhances user privacy and security by allowing users to control the app's access to their device resources and personal data. By requesting only the necessary permissions, the app can foster user trust and mitigate privacy concerns.

### Implications
1. The app's functionality should be reviewed to identify the specific permissions required for its core features.
2. The user interface should be designed to inform users about the purpose and importance of each permission request, providing transparency and building trust.
3. The team should stay updated with platform-specific permission guidelines and best practices.
