## Summary
This ADR aims to determine the most suitable data storage approach for the mobile application developed for the retail company, considering factors such as data security, performance, scalability, offline capability, and development simplicity.

### Issue
The development team needs to decide on the data storage approach to be used for the mobile application's data, including user profiles, product data, and transaction history.

### Decision
After evaluating the requirements and constraints, the team has decided to use a combination of local device storage (SQLite or Realm) for offline-capable data and a cloud-based database (Firebase Firestore) for centralized and synchronized data.

### Status
Accepted

## Details

### Assumptions
1. The retail company requires offline capability for certain app features.
2. The team has experience and familiarity with local database technologies (SQLite or Realm) and cloud-based databases (Firebase Firestore).
3. The app's data storage requirements can be efficiently implemented using the chosen technologies.

### Constraints
1. Limited development time and budget.
2. The data storage approach should ensure data security and privacy.
3. The app should support efficient data synchronization between the local device storage and the cloud database.

### Positions
1. Local Device Storage: Offers offline capability, fast data retrieval, and storage of user-specific data.
2. Cloud-based Database: Provides centralized and synchronized data storage, scalability, and real-time updates.

### Argument

### Implications
1. The team needs to design and implement synchronization logic between the local device storage and the cloud-based database to ensure data consistency.
2. Data security measures, such as encryption and access control, should be implemented to protect sensitive user and transaction data.
3. The team should consider monitoring and optimizing data storage and retrieval operations to maintain good performance.
