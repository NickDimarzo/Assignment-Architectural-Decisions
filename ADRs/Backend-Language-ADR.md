## Summary
This ADR aims to determine the most suitable backend language for the mobile application developed for the retail company, considering factors such as performance, scalability, developer expertise, ecosystem support, and integration with other system components.

### Issue
The development team needs to decide on the backend language to be used for implementing the server-side logic and APIs for the mobile application.

### Decision
After evaluating the requirements and constraints, the team has decided to use Node.js as the backend language for the mobile app.

### Status
Accepted

## Details

### Assumptions
1. The retail company's backend infrastructure supports Node.js.
2. The team has familiarity and expertise in Node.js development.
3. The backend language should provide good performance and scalability for handling concurrent API requests.

### Constraints
1. Limited development time and budget.
2. The backend language should integrate well with the chosen frontend technology (e.g., React Native) and other system components.

### Positions
1. Node.js: Offers non-blocking, event-driven architecture, good performance, scalability, and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

2. Other Backend Languages: Provide alternative options but may have different performance characteristics and potentially require additional learning and development effort.

### Argument
Using Node.js as the backend language aligns with the retail company's requirements and constraints. It offers a scalable and performant solution for handling concurrent API requests. The team's existing expertise in JavaScript will also facilitate development, and the extensive ecosystem of Node.js libraries and frameworks will support rapid development and integration with other system components.

### Implications
1. Leveraging Node.js will allow for efficient server-side logic and API development.
2. The team may need to carefully select and evaluate Node.js frameworks and libraries that best suit the requirements of the mobile application.
3. The backend infrastructure must support Node.js deployment and runtime.
